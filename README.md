I am Jacob, a recent BSc (Hons) Software Engineering graduate from UCLan with a passion for creating quality software
and contributing to open source projects. I maintain [CURPSuite][curpsuite], a library to parse and validate [CURP][curp]
numbers, which has over 18k downloads on PyPI. I am also part of @MagicWeAre, the freelance mobile development team behind
[Hospitality Calculators][hcapp], released for both Android and iOS, with an install base of thousands of users.

Feel welcome to take a look at my work by browsing my repositories.


## Technologies
My preferred programming languages are C++, Java, Python, and Dart.

### Cloud
I have used Firebase in mobile apps, integrating authentication, storage, and database. I have also used AWS to create
virtual machines with EC2 and Lightsail, as well as static websites using Amplify. Finally, I have some experience with
Azure VMs.

### UI
In desktop, I have worked entensively with Qt and Gtk to create top notch user experiences.
As for mobile, I have mostly worked with two frameworks: Flutter and Android Layouts.

### Web
My first development experience was actually in web, using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After that, I taught myself
PHP and MySQL, both of which I used when I created my first dynamic website, [youclan][youclan].
Afterwards I also learned about creating backends with Django, express.js, and Nest.js, which I have paired with frontends
featuring Vue.js and Svelte.

### Embedded
I have extensive experience with Zephyr RTOS and the nRF Connect SDK to create embedded software, for hardware
which I have at times designed myself. One example of this is my final year project, where I designed and implemented
an inertial measurement unit from the ground up.
